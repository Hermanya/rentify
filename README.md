Rentify is a service that lets you rent things from other people or rent things to people. Renting is cheaper and more effective than possessing nowadays. This applies to anything but I will provide an example that will demonstrates that temporar owning is way ahead of constant possessions. 

An example from my own life – me and friend are students, who want to go on a canoe trip. We have a limited budget and don’t have enough room to store a canoe in our apartments. We also know for sure, that we would not go on a canoe trip too often, but rather we would like to try it. So it’s not worth buying it.

The cheapest and the most convenient way to rent things is to rent them from other people. Our service Rentify connects people so they can rent things from each other. You can search for things that you like, things that are fun and get them for a period of time that you need for a tiny price compared to buying them or using business-oriented rental services. 

I’m sure that you have things covering in dust in your closet – why not make use of them and make a little money?
